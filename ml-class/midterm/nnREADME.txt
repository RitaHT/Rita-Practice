The package includes all the data and function needed. 
Here are the steps I do with the neural network:

1) run nnAnalysis.m, and get a usable matrix X.
2) run nnTrain.m, and get a useful matrix nn_Thetas.
3) run nnTest.m, and make predictions of the test set. It will automatically write the predictions into the test_submission.csv
